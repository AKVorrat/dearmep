# Format the code. Sort imports first, as recommended by
# <https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#sorting-imports>. This should also
# satisfy the recommendation of running the linter with ISC disabled before
# running the formatter, as noted in the ISC001 and ISC002 rules.

# (hopefully because they're false positives).

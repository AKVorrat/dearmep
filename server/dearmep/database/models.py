    Destinations may be "selected" for different reasons, and depending on the
    reason, it might have different effects on whether the Destination can be
    selected again, and if so, with which probability. The following kinds of
    selection are currently supported:

    * `WEB_SUGGESTED`: The Destination has been displayed to a User in the Web
      frontend, e.g. because the user hit “suggest random”, or searched for a
      Destination by name. This should only have a weak influence on the
      Destination’s “suggestability”: It may happen that the User decides to
      call this Destination, but they could also let the system suggest someone
      else, or not make a call at all.
    * `IVR_SUGGESTED`: The Destination has been suggested to a User who is
      currently in a call with our IVR menu. This can happen if the Destination
      the user initially requested to call is unavailable, in which case the
      system tries to suggest someone else. As the User is already on the phone
      with us, chances are relatively high that they’ll accept this suggestion
      and call that Destination.
    * `CALLING_USER`: The User has requested to be called, in order to be
      connected to this Destination. This is the case when the User clicks on
      “call now” in the web frontend. Now, the system tries to call the User’s
      phone and place them into the IVR menu, targeting this Destination.
    * `IN_MENU`: We have successfully established a call with the User, they
      are currently in the IVR menu, targeting this Destination.
    * `CALLING_DESTINATION`: The User has asked the IVR menu to be connected to
      this Destination now, all sanity checks have been completed successfully
      and the system is now trying to establish a call with the Destination.
      This means that it makes little sense to try calling the same Destination
      for another User right now.
    * `DESTINATION_CONNECTED`: The system has successfully connected the User
      and the Destination, and they are probably talking at the moment. It is
      useless to try calling this Destination for another User.
    * `FINISHED_SHORT_CALL`: The call between User and Destination has been
      completed. They were only talking for a short time, and it’s probably
      okay to assume that only an assistant or voicemail has been reached, but
      not the actual Member of Parliament.
    * `FINISHED_CALL`: The call between User and Destination has been
      completed. Also, they were talking long enough to assume that the Member
      of Parliament has actually been reached and talked to.
    * `CALL_ABORTED`: The call has been aborted prematurely, e.g. because the
      User hung up before being connected to the Destination, or because the
      User was never called due to policy reasons, etc.
    * `CALLING_USER_FAILED`: The system was unable to call the User due to an
      unexpected error. No call was established.
    * `CALLING_DESTINATION_FAILED`: The system was in a call with the User, and
      the User requested to be connected to the Destination, but the
      Destination call could not be established due to an unexpected error.

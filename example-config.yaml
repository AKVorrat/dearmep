# Options ending in `_duration` or `_timeout` (or simply named `duration` or
# `timeout`) should be specified in seconds, unless noted otherwise.

# Options ending in `_limit` (or simply named `limit`) should contain a string
# compatible to the notation used by the `limits` Python library. See
# <https://limits.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#rate-limit-string-notation>.
# If a limit is being documented as applying "per IP address", the exact
# definition may be more complex, especially when it comes to IPv6.


# Campaign metadata.
campaign:

  # The name of the campaign.
  name: Stop Scanning Me!


# User authentication.
authentication:

  # A user's session, usually identified via a one-time code sent via SMS. These
  # are managed via a non-permanent JWT session cookie that will get deleted
  # once the user closes their browser window or logs out manually.
  session:

    # How long until the session times out due to inactivity. Any API request
    # with a valid token will reset this timeout.
    inactivity_timeout: 7200

    # How long until the session times out regardless of any activity. This
    # timeout does not reset. A new verification will need to take place once it
    # has been reached. Its main purpose is to ensure that the user still owns
    # the phone number, even if they artificially kept the session alive for
    # days or even months.
    authentication_timeout: 86400


# Options regarding phone calls and SMS.
telephony:

  # Verifying phone numbers by sending an SMS to that number.
  sms_verification:

    # How long until verification codes sent via SMS expire.
    timeout: 900

    # After this many codes have been sent to a certain number without any of
    # them being converted into a Session Token, add the number to a block list.
    # It cannot be used again before being manually unlocked by an admin. This
    # is to prevent spamming a victim with codes, incurring costs.
    max_unused: 3

    # How many verifications may be requested (possibly for different phone
    # numbers, think call party behind a NAT) per IP address?
    per_ip_limit: 3 per second, 10 per 6 hours

    # How many SMS messages may the system send overall?
    send_limit: 5 per second, 100 per hour


# Localization options.
l10n:
  # The languages your campaign is available in. You have to use a language tag
  # as defined in RFC 5646. (Try not to be over-specific though. `en-UK` is
  # fine, `de-Latn-DE-1996` might be overdoing it and cause issues when auto-
  # detecting a user's language.) The first value in this list will be the
  # default if the user's browser claims they accept `*` (i.e. "any language").
  # You therefore probably want to make sure that the first value here is
  # identical to the `default_language` set below.
  languages: [ en, de-AT ]

  # Which language to fall back to if there is no localized message available
  # for the user's language. Every string defined under `strings` needs to have
  # a value provided for this language. This is also what the language auto-
  # detection falls back to if the user does not specify a supported language
  # in their preferences. This has to be one of the languages defined in the
  # `languages` list above.
  default_language: en

  # Which MMDB geo-IP lookup database to use. Supply the file name relative to
  # the working directory you're invoking the application from, or use an
  # absolute path. If you do not set this value, IP-based geolocation will not
  # be used.
  # You may choose any MMDB, as long as the lookup results in a dict with a key
  # `country` that contains either the ISO code as a string, or a sub-dict with
  # a key `iso_code` that then contains the ISO code.
  # Check out <https://github.com/geoacumen/geoacumen-country> for a free MMDB.
  geo_mmdb: Geoacumen-Country.mmdb

  # Localized/translated strings.
  # Each of the keys below `strings` defines a translateable string. You may
  # either set the value to a simple string, in which case it will be used
  # regardless of the user's language (good for single-language campaigns), but
  # the recommended way is to provide a mapping of languages to strings.
  # TODO: Explain further.
  # The following placeholders are available in all of the strings:
  #   {campaign}  The configured campaign name.
  strings:

    # Name of the campaign. This will be available in every other l10n string
    # via the {campaign} placeholder.
    campaign_name: Stop Scanning Me

    # Content of SMS sent to users when we need to verify their phone number.
    # {code} will be replaced by a six-digit random number.
